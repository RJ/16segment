check that i have bolts + nuts!
	needs to be +8mm, maybe 12? 16?
	32 per digit?
	32 * 8 == 256
	or wedges? [wedges]

librecad surround to work out wire lengths
	mounting holes in corner peices [done]
	wedges [done]
	try to fit parts better [done]
	test cut [done, needs diags]
	

Cut up strips, solder wires
work out board layout + wires
make a board
test with cut segments
design backing [done]
laser cut backing

smallest unit is 5cm

lhs windows are 77 x 86cm

4 x diagonals		18.4
2 x horizontals		9
2 x top and bottom	17.0
4 x sides		16.
2 x central bits	14

height			32


so height in window = 55, 10 segments, 

			(segments)
4 x diagonials		6 x 4	24
2 x horizontals		3 x 2	6
2 x top and bottom	7 x 2	14
4 x sides		5 x 4	20
2 x central bits	5 x 2	10
				--
	total per display	74
			=	3.7m

for 6 displays = 444 segments = 2220,
for 9 displays = 666 segments = 3330,

need to switch 14 * 9 segments == 126

need 15.75 ULN2083's, so either chain different chars together or to 2 each,
so 18, which would give us 4 extra outputs so maybe do 16 segment dislays
with . as well.

maybe look at fonts

i2c io expanders?
spi io expanders?

a cheap mcu per char?

2 x darlington
2 x shift
